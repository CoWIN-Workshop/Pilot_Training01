# Pilot_Training
Welcome to HKU – Geography/STEM Pilot Workshop 

2021 - 09 - 25 (Sat)

********************************************************************

Fieldwork in physical geography involves the process of observing and collecting environmental data to learn about the dynamic world. It is a field of science specialized in studying the lands, features, inhabitants,and phenomena of the Earth. In Hong Kong, Geography has been labelled as a non-science subject, which hinders its curriculum development in the field of applied/environmental science or as an interdisciplinary subject in STEM education. In this workshop, integration of STEM education into environmental (field) sampling and data analysis in Geography fieldwork will be performed. 

The workshop will provide students with a refreshing interdisciplinary STEM learning experience from the perspective of Geography. 

Activities include:

**Day 1**
1) STEM lecture on Arduino-based technology,
2) Build your own temperature instrument,
3) Instrumental calibration experiment,
4) Introduction to CAD drawing and 3D printing technology,

**Day 2**

5) Group sharing and discussion,
6) Arduino programming,
7) Field sampling – Weather Orienteering at HKU, and
8) GPS positioning and data analysis

Throughout the workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand the structure and major components of a microcomputer system (Arduino in this project). 
- Apply programming techniques and integrate electronic components and units for simple product design.
- Demonstrate skills in computer-aided-draughting to produce detailed 2D and 3D drawings.
- Design environmental sensors for different measurement campaign purposes.
- Develop citizen science projects to study and analyse data from the environment.
